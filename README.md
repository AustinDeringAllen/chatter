# Chatter

A web application that allows users to sign-in through Discord via NextAuth and then create or join a chat room and communicate with other people that are online and connected to that chat room.

TODO:

- Show how many users are in each available room
- Add private room functionality so it won't show on the room list.
- Clean up some messy file structure like the two tailwind configs.
